# Interest-Rate-Predictor
Cohort 11 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.

Abstract: 
The purpose of this project is to create a model that should be able to predict the Interest Rate for 12, 24, 36-month term loans based on the consumer input and other variables. The end product of the project is an Interactive Personal Loan Calculator which can be embed in various informative websites. The calculator can help customers to simulate a real-life application process without having to share their sensitive personal information.
